## Feature issues (1–28)

### Idea 1: In-app notification center
- Parent epic: E1
- Summary: One place for all in-app notifications: bonus improved (wishlist), renewal reminder, points expiring, referral qualified, system announcements — so users don’t miss important updates.
- Rationale / value: **Foundation.** Many features (expiry, wishlist, churn, referral) will push notifications. Build this first so we don’t bolt notifications on later.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/01-notification-center.md](../docs-ideas/01-notification-center.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 2: Points expiry alerts
- Parent epic: E2
- Summary: Help users not lose points: they set an expiry date per program (or per card), and get reminded by email or in-app before points expire.
- Rationale / value: High user value (“don’t lose points”). Depends on notification center (and optional email).
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/02-points-expiry-alerts.md](../docs-ideas/02-points-expiry-alerts.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 3: Export reports (CSV/PDF)
- Parent epic: E3
- Summary: Let users export their data (cards, snapshots, timeline) as CSV or PDF for their records, taxes, or sharing with an advisor.
- Rationale / value: Quick win, no new infra. Increases stickiness and perceived value.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/03-export-reports.md](../docs-ideas/03-export-reports.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 4: CSV import
- Parent epic: E3
- Summary: Let users bulk-import cards or snapshot history from a CSV (e.g. export from another tool or their own spreadsheet) so they don’t have to type everything.
- Rationale / value: Reduces onboarding friction; complements export.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/04-csv-import.md](../docs-ideas/04-csv-import.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 5: Spend simulator
- Parent epic: E4
- Summary: Answer "If I put $X/month on this card, when do I hit the minimum spend?" so users can plan realistically.
- Rationale / value: Core planning value: “When will I hit min spend?” Uses existing card/snapshot data.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/05-spend-simulator.md](../docs-ideas/05-spend-simulator.md)

### Idea 6: Redemption calculator
- Parent epic: E4
- Summary: "I have X Aeroplan (or other) points — what can I get?" Rough value in $ or sample redemptions (flights, hotels) to make points tangible.
- Rationale / value: Core value: “What is my balance worth?” Uses existing points data.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/06-redemption-calculator.md](../docs-ideas/06-redemption-calculator.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 7: Card comparison tool
- Parent epic: E5
- Summary: Side-by-side comparison of 2–3 cards (from catalogue or user's cards) so users can choose the best offer.
- Rationale / value: Differentiator; uses catalogue + user cards. Good before marketing push.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/07-card-comparison-tool.md](../docs-ideas/07-card-comparison-tool.md)

### Idea 8: Churn reminder
- Parent epic: E2
- Summary: Remind users before a card's annual fee hits or before they're "safe" to product-switch or cancel (e.g. 11–12 months after opening) so they don't forget to optimize.
- Rationale / value: High value (renewal / product switch). Uses card open dates; can use notification center.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/08-churn-reminder.md](../docs-ideas/08-churn-reminder.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 9: Wishlist / watchlist
- Parent epic: E5
- Summary: Let users save "I'm interested in these cards" from the catalogue and get notified when the bonus improves (or when we add new info), so they know when to apply.
- Rationale / value: Ties to Bonus Value Tracking; “notify when bonus improves.” Needs notification center.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/09-wishlist-watchlist.md](../docs-ideas/09-wishlist-watchlist.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 10: Email digest
- Parent epic: E6
- Summary: Keep users engaged and informed: weekly or monthly email with summary of their cards, any catalogue changes (e.g. bonus improved for a card they have), and tips or product updates.
- Rationale / value: Re-engagement; needs email sending. Build after core in-app notifications.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/10-email-digest.md](../docs-ideas/10-email-digest.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 11: Milestones & badges
- Parent epic: E6
- Summary: Light gamification: celebrate "First card added", "Met min spend on 3 cards", "5 cards in pipeline", etc., with badges and optional shareable card (image or link).
- Rationale / value: Gamification and retention; no hard dependencies.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.

### Idea 12: Share card offer
- Parent epic: E8
- Summary: Let users share a specific card offer (from catalogue) with a friend — "Apply here" link. If we have affiliate links, we can earn when they apply; otherwise it's just shareable link for better UX.
- Rationale / value: Growth with low effort: share link / public offer page. Optional affiliate later.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/12-share-card-offer.md](../docs-ideas/12-share-card-offer.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 13: Referral program
- Parent epic: E8
- Summary: Grow user base: each user gets a unique referral link; when a new user signs up via that link and completes an action (e.g. adds first card), the referrer gets a reward (e.g. extended trial, badge, or future premium benefit).
- Rationale / value: Growth and viral loop; can tie reward to “first card added” or similar.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/13-referral-program.md](../docs-ideas/13-referral-program.md)

### Idea 14: Family / household view
- Parent epic: E9
- Summary: Let two (or more) users link accounts as "household" to see combined cards and points in one view — useful for couples or families optimizing together.
- Rationale / value: Optional; more complex (invites, permissions). Good after core is solid.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/14-family-household-view.md](../docs-ideas/14-family-household-view.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 15: Browser extension
- Parent epic: E9
- Summary: When user is on a Milesopedia card page (or partner site), one click to "Add to PointTracker" — pre-fill from page or open app with context, so adding cards is frictionless.
- Rationale / value: Reduces friction adding cards; needs deep link + optional extension build.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/15-browser-extension.md](../docs-ideas/15-browser-extension.md)

### Idea 16: Public deal board
- Parent epic: E10
- Summary: A feed of "hot deals" or data points from the community (e.g. "AMEX 80k seen today", "DP: approved with 2 existing AMEX") — anonymous, upvote/downvote, to help others time their applications.
- Rationale / value: Community; needs moderation and UGC policy.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/16-public-deal-board.md](../docs-ideas/16-public-deal-board.md)

### Idea 17: Multi-currency / multi-program
- Parent epic: E10
- Summary: Support cards or programs beyond current Canadian focus — e.g. USD cards, US cards (Chase, Amex US), or other programs — so the app serves expats, cross-border, or future markets.
- Rationale / value: Expansion (e.g. USD, US cards). Do when ready to broaden market.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/17-multi-currency-programs.md](../docs-ideas/17-multi-currency-programs.md)
- Clarification follow-ups: [docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md](../docs-ideas/IDEA-CLARIFICATION-QUESTIONS.md)

### Idea 18: API for power users
- Parent epic: E11
- Summary: Offer a read-only API (API key per user) so power users can pull their cards and snapshots into their own spreadsheets, dashboards, or scripts — differentiation and potential premium tier.
- Rationale / value: Read-only API; natural **premium** candidate.

### Idea 23: Active bonus trackers UI (improvement)
- Parent epic: E7
- Summary: Upgrade the **“current bonuses in progress”** view into a clear, card-style **Active Bonus Trackers** section, showing per-card min spend progress, time left, and reward — similar to the mock (e.g. Chase Sapphire card with `$3,245 / $4,000`, `32 days left`, `$755 to go`, and `60,000 pts`).
- Rationale / value: Rich “Active Bonus Trackers” section (progress bars, days left, $ remaining) built on Card Pipeline / AI Bonus Plan. **Prerequisite:** schema `welcomeBonusCompletedAt`, `minSpend` on Card. Drives daily engagement.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.

### Idea 26: Family points ledger & valuations
- Parent epic: E14
- Summary: Replace the manual “family points totals” spreadsheet with an in-app **points ledger** that tracks balances per program, per person (Jo, My, etc.), and shows the **cash-equivalent value** based on your own cents-per-point assumptions.
- Rationale / value: Central place to define point programs and cents-per-point valuations (per family or user). Becomes the backbone for points balance, travel goals, and optimization features.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.

### Idea 27: Earn-rate matrix & spend optimizer
- Parent epic: E14
- Summary: Turn your “Valeurs 1$ / [category]” spreadsheet columns into an in-app **earn-rate matrix** and **spend optimizer** that tells you which card to use for each category, and estimates value earned from your monthly budget.
- Rationale / value: Uses the ledger (26) to build a matrix of value per dollar by category and a simple optimizer to suggest which card to use for each type of spend. Advanced but high value for power users.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/27-earn-rate-matrix-and-spend-optimizer.md](../docs-ideas/27-earn-rate-matrix-and-spend-optimizer.md)

### Idea 28: Card history & reactivation insights
- Parent epic: E15
- Summary: Model your detailed “Historique cartes de crédit” sheet in the app so you can see your **full card history** (open → close → reopen → refused), and get **reactivation insights** such as “when can I get this card again?” and “how much value have I already extracted from this bank/program?”.
- Rationale / value: Surfaced history of when cards were opened/closed and when they might be eligible again. Builds on existing card data; nice-to-have once core tracking and dashboards are in place.
- Acceptance criteria / deliverables: pull “What we build”, “Phases”, and dependencies into checklist items.
- Source doc: [docs-ideas/28-card-history-and-reactivation-insights.md](../docs-ideas/28-card-history-and-reactivation-insights.md)
