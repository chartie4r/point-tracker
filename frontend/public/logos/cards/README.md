# Card network logos (minimal / flat)

Minimal vector-style icons for Visa, Mastercard, and Amex used on the credit card preview.

**Replace with Unblast icons (optional):**  
You can use the [4 Free Minimal Vector Credit Card Icons](https://unblast.com/4-free-minimal-vector-credit-card-icons/) from Graphic Pear (Unblast). After downloading the pack:

1. Export or save the VISA, Mastercard, and American Express icons as SVG (or PNG).
2. Replace `visa.svg`, `mastercard.svg`, and `amex.svg` in this folder with your files, keeping the same filenames so the app picks them up.

The app loads these via `/logos/cards/visa.svg`, `/logos/cards/mastercard.svg`, `/logos/cards/amex.svg`. The `CardNetworkLogo` component applies a white filter on dark backgrounds when the `light` prop is used.
